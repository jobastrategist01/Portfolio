Welcome to my most recent projects, **where the synergy of industrial design, research, and marketing converges to create captivating user experiences and brand connections**. With industrial design, a discipline that empowers me to delve deep into user interactions, enhancing engagement with products. Transitioning from physical products to emotional bonds, I bring the essence of design into marketing. **Every campaign is a story, connecting users and clients through emotions.**

In this portfolio, witness the seamless blend of creativity and analytical thinking. It's not just about aesthetics; **it's about understanding, analyzing, and strategically shaping experiences that leave lasting impressions.**

## Research and Data

**"Knowledge is power"** and data-driven decisions. This phrase is everything. In the past 10 years, my work has involved researching deep down to the core of business problems and presenting solutions. In marketing, you don't only see your results and numbers; you have to track your competitors (*and in some cases, find out who your real competitors are*) to create strategies that not only allow you to stay in the playground but also succeed and gain an advantage.

In every job I've undertaken, the first thing I do is implement a data gathering system aiming to understand how the market is behaving and what the company needs to do to gain that advantage. These are some of the projects that I can share from my studies.
